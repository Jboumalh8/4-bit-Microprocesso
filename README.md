# 4-bit-Microprocessor

The mircoprocessor was built using Logisim software. The file provdided includes all the subsystems that were initially designed to finally build the CPU

To operate the circuit, the file provided should be opened using Logisim, and the functions the CPU performs are the following:

- Adding and Subtracting
- Right Shifting and Left Shifting
- Multiplication
- Division
- XNOR
- AND
- OR
- NOT A
- XOR
- NAND
- NOR
- NOT B

PS: The CPU is operated manually, as there is no language in which to program this mircroprocessor
